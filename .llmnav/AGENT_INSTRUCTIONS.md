# LLMNav agent protocol

## LLMNav code navigation

<!-- llmnav:start -->
Before broad grep, directory scans, or opening many source files, run `npm exec -- llmnav query "<task>" --top 5`.

Resolve the selected semantic ID with `npm exec -- llmnav show <id>`. Use `npm exec -- llmnav context <id> --depth 1 --budget 2500` when related policy, workflow, fallback, migration, or test cards are needed.

When the host supports structured tools, load the provider-neutral definitions from `npm exec -- llmnav tools --json`. Keep the repository root bound by the host rather than accepting it from model-generated tool input.

Read generated cards and signatures before opening full symbol bodies. Treat paths, line numbers, signatures, imports, and hashes as generated data rather than source-of-truth annotations.

Keep an existing LLMNav ID when a symbol or file is renamed or moved. Change `role`, `invariant`, `effect`, `risk`, and semantic `rel` values only when behavior or contracts change.

Do not add hand-maintained `calls`, `imports`, `references`, `implements`, `exports`, or `overrides` relations. Do not put paths, line numbers, commit hashes, timestamps, callers, or current signatures in LLMNav source comments.

After initialization and whenever public entrypoints, commands, routes, schemas, migrations, or high fan-in modules change, run `npm exec -- llmnav audit`. Review high and medium candidates; never add cards automatically. Add a module card only after confirming a durable responsibility, then encode the accepted boundary in a path-specific `coverageRules` entry and add a representative retrieval query. When a reviewed candidate has no durable navigation responsibility, record its exact path and a concrete reason in `audit.dispositions`; never use a glob or broad directory suppression.

When deciding whether one specific file needs a card, run `npm exec -- llmnav explain <file>`. Use its coverage, score, and disposition evidence to guide review, but never turn its recommendation into automatic source annotation.

After semantic changes, run `npm exec -- llmnav format`, `npm exec -- llmnav check`, and `npm exec -- llmnav generate`. Use broad text search only when LLMNav returns no credible candidate.
